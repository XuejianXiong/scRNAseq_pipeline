## Step 4: Normalization, Highly Variable Genes, and Dimensionality Reduction

In this step, we perform essential preprocessing and dimensionality reduction techniques to reveal the underlying biological structure of the single-cell transcriptomic data:

### 1. Normalization and Log-Transformation

Why? Raw counts differ widely between cells due to sequencing depth and capture efficiency. Normalization (e.g., total counts per cell scaled to a common value) ensures comparability between cells by removing such technical biases.

Log-transformation helps stabilize variance and reduces skewness, making gene expression values more suitable for downstream analyses like PCA.

### 2. Identification of Highly Variable Genes (HVGs)

Biological meaning: HVGs are genes whose expression varies significantly across cells beyond technical noise. These genes often represent biological heterogeneity â€” e.g., genes marking different cell types, states, or responses.

Why keep HVGs? Focusing on HVGs reduces noise and computational burden, improving the detection of meaningful biological patterns.

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA reduces dimensionality by summarizing the main axes of variation in the data.

The first few principal components often capture key biological differences (e.g., cell types or conditions), enabling better visualization and clustering.

### 4. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)

UMAP projects the high-dimensional data into two dimensions while preserving both local and global structure.

This allows visualization of cellular heterogeneity, identifying distinct clusters or trajectories reflecting biological processes.

### Interpretation of the Results

The HVG plot highlights genes driving biological variability. Genes marked as highly variable (colored in the plot) are strong candidates for further investigation, such as marker genes.

The PCA plot shows how cells separate based on the principal axes of variation. Clear clustering suggests distinct cell populations or states.

The UMAP plot provides an intuitive, visual map of the cellular landscape, often revealing subpopulations or gradients reflecting developmental or treatment effects.
